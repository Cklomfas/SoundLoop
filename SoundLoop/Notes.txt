tasks:
implement a playback loop function.
record until stopped.
playback until stopped.


RECORD:
Enqueue more buffers for recording. this is done in the callback method.

Things to research:
-ActionMode.Callback
---Callback/callbacks
* callbacks are registered with OpenSL objects to be called when a buffer is 
cleared. I need to make sure that I keep track of the number of buffers for
recording/playback reasons. E.g. playback will need to know where the next 
buffer is so it can play it. Same with record. *
---ActionMode

-Menu/menus 
---context menus
